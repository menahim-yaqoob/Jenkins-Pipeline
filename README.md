Apache2 Jenkins Pipeline is a DevOps demonstration project that showcases how to automate the deployment of a web server using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and Docker.

The project includes:

A Dockerfile that builds a lightweight Apache2 web server container.

A Jenkins Groovy Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) that builds and runs the container automatically.

A YAML-based Jenkins pipeline for those who prefer YAML configuration.

A step-by-step guide (README.md) to help beginners run the pipeline locally or through Jenkins.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Automate system update & Apache2 installation using Jenkins.

Build and run Apache2 inside a Docker container.

Demonstrate both Groovy and YAML Jenkins pipelines.

Provide a clean, GitHub-ready DevOps portfolio project.
